# Ba Dum Tss!

I started series called
[Terrible Shell Scripting](https://chabik.com/terrible-shell-scripting-interactive-shell/)
on my blog. As I progress with different shell scripts, going deeper in how
terrible they are, I needed a place where I can share these snippets. That will
do, I guess 🤷🏻‍♂️
